     - Hierarchical clustering methods (agglomerative and divisive).
     - Other clustering techniques such as DBSCAN, GMM, and Spectral Clustering.

2. **Algorithm Implementation**
   - Implemented **K-Means** and **Hierarchical Clustering** algorithms in Python for conceptual clarity.
   - Analysed sample datasets to visualise cluster formations and compare performances.

3. **Review Paper Drafting**
   - Structured the review paper covering:
     - Introduction to clustering  
     - Detailed study on K-Means and Hierarchical clustering  
     - Overview of other clustering algorithms  
     - Comparative analysis  
     - Applications in image segmentation, market segmentation, anomaly detection, and bioinformatics
